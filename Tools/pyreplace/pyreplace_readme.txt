pyreplace is a script for searching through the files in MatrixPilot directories and replacing words with alternatives.

It tests the words with pre and post delimiteres to make sure that they are an exact match to the word and not part of something else.

It's primary setup is to convert int and long types to int16_t, uint16_t etc....
