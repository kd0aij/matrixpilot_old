16 July: successful test flight in manual, stabilized and auto (waypoints) mode
	Addiction aircraft with production sample UDB5 and 3DR LEA6 GPS module using
	the same options.h settings as AVC, but with race mode off
	* need to reduce elevator boost and auto mode bank angle
	* logfile apparently corrupt; check mavlink baud rate

17 July: copied from -udb5-mw to configure bench testing with em406

19 July: began testing 64mips option
	*** note that analog2digital_udb4/5 are hard-coded for 16mips
	fixed bug in mpu.c: incorrect oscillator setting for 32MIPS

21 July: 40 MIPS support for UDB5 working, fixed ADC support for UDB5 (it was burning
	about 10% of the cpu at all speeds) now set to sample at ~25KHz regardless
	of FCY frequency.
	Tested at 16, 32 and 40MIPS: 8%, 4% and 3% cpu load, respectively.

17 August: need to flight test UDB5 at 40MIPS/200Hz

25 September 2013: copied from UDB5 project
	HILSIM badly broken: problems with throttle control and waypoint following

28 September: waypoints and Logo navigation working properly now with Xplane10
	Throttle "problem" was apparently due to ALT_HOLD_THROTTLE_MIN set to 0.8.
	Changed to 0.25 and HILSIM throttle seems good.
