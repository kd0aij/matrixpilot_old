project -udb4.X copied from -udb5.X on 24 July 2013

attempt to use prebuilt libVectorMatrix binary unsuccessful; link command
references correct file, but linker claims symbols are undefined. This works
in both the UDB5 and AUAV3 projects. Current workaround is to include the libVectorMatrix
sources in the compile.

Not yet bench tested
