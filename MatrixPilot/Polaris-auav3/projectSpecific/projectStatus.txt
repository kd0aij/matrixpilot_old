16 July: successful test flight in manual, stabilized and auto (waypoints) mode
	Addiction aircraft with production sample UDB5 and 3DR LEA6 GPS module using
	the same options.h settings as AVC, but with race mode off
	* need to reduce elevator boost and auto mode bank angle
	* logfile apparently corrupt; check mavlink baud rate

17 July: copied from -udb5-mw to configure bench testing with em406

19 July: began testing 64mips option
	*** note that analog2digital_udb4/5 are hard-coded for 16mips
	fixed bug in mpu.c: incorrect oscillator setting for 32MIPS

21 July: 40 MIPS support for UDB5 working, fixed ADC support for UDB5 (it was burning
	about 10% of the cpu at all speeds) now set to sample at ~25KHz regardless
	of FCY frequency.
	Tested udb5 at 16, 32 and 40MIPS: 8%, 4% and 3% cpu load, respectively.

	new project auav3-em406 copied from udb5-em406, symbol AUAV3 defined and mcu changed
	turned off NVRAM and I2C1 driver in nv_memory_options.h since auav3 has no eeprom
	changed ADC driver to sample at 25KHz instead of 500KHz
	* appears to be working correctly at 16MIPS, but not at 32 or 64
	* at 32mips, IMU works correctly for a brief period but usually fails while still
	  in acquiringS state
	* cpu load 11% at 16mips, 3% higher than udb5

22 July:
	validated new version of analog2digital_auav3.c with 25KHz sample rate
	* MAVlink now reporting ACSP1 CSV (battery voltage) correctly in millivolts

23 July:
	project auav3-mtek copied from auav3-em406
	modified cpu load measurement to use 32 bit timer 8/9 when USE_MCU_IDLE==1
	tested with USE_MCU_IDLE==1 at:
	70MIPS: load 2.6%
	64MIPS: load 2.9%	2.6 * (70/64) = 2.84
	16MIPS: load 11.4%	2.5 * (70/16) = 11.38

2 August:
	tested with USE_MAVLINK_DBGIO and USE_RING_BUFFER: cpu load 3.6%

3 August:
	bench test MPU6000 synchronous IMU updates with HEARTBEAT_HZ = 200, with
	mavlink packet writes to ring buffer at IPL6
	created new project Polaris-auav3

4 August:
	maidened Polaris Ultra at Long Lake. Trim fairly good. Stabilization gains seem
	OK, nav. gains too low.

8 August: increased nav. roll authority to about 45 degrees of bank and increased
	roll_elev_mix to 1.0
