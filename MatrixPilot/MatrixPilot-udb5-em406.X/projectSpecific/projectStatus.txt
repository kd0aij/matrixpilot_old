16 July: successful test flight in manual, stabilized and auto (waypoints) mode
	Addiction aircraft with production sample UDB5 and 3DR LEA6 GPS module using
	the same options.h settings as AVC, but with race mode off
	* need to reduce elevator boost and auto mode bank angle
	* logfile apparently corrupt; check mavlink baud rate

17 July: copied from -udb5-mw to configure bench testing with em406

19 July: began testing 64mips option
	*** note that analog2digital_udb4/5 are hard-coded for 16mips
	fixed bug in mpu.c: incorrect oscillator setting for 32MIPS
