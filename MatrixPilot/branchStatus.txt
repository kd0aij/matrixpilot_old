16 July: successful test flight in manual, stabilized and auto (waypoints) mode
	Addiction aircraft with production sample UDB5 and 3DR LEA6 GPS module using
	the same options.h settings as AVC, but with race mode off
	* need to reduce elevator boost and auto mode bank angle
	* logfile apparently corrupt; check mavlink baud rate

19 July: began testing 64mips option
	*** note that analog2digital_udb4/5 are hard-coded for 16mips
	fixed bug in mpu.c: incorrect oscillator setting for 32MIPS

21 July: 40 MIPS support for UDB5 working, fixed ADC support for UDB5 (it was burning
	about 10% of the cpu at all speeds) now set to sample at ~25KHz regardless
	of FCY frequency.
	Tested udb5 at 16, 32 and 40MIPS: 8%, 4% and 3% cpu load, respectively.

	changed AUAV3 ADC driver to sample at 25KHz instead of 500KHz
	* appears to be working correctly at 16MIPS, but not at 32 or 64
	* at 32mips, IMU works correctly for a brief period but usually fails while still
	  in acquiringS state
	* cpu load 11% at 16mips, 3% higher than udb5

22 July:
	validated new version of analog2digital_auav3.c with 25KHz sample rate
	* MAVlink now reporting ACSP1 CSV (battery voltage) correctly in millivolts

23 July:
	modified cpu load measurement to use 32 bit timer 8/9 when USE_MCU_IDLE==1
	tested with USE_MCU_IDLE==1 at:
	70MIPS: load 2.6%
	64MIPS: load 2.9%	2.6 * (70/64) = 2.84
	16MIPS: load 11.4%	2.5 * (70/16) = 11.38

Bug??? using COF linker output format, linking with static lib VectorMatrix.a doesn't work

26 July: bench tested at 40mips: cpu load showing 4.6% with mavlink
	move magnetometerOptions.h from libUDB to MatrixPilot/projectSpecific
	and modify rmat.c include statement

28 July: start finishing up the HEARTBEAT_HZ parameterization; changes needed to all
	the GPS drivers and to rmat.c

29 July: add a MAVlink non-blocking debug I/O option: text strings display in the
	QGroundControl Communication Console; controlled by macro USE_MAVLINK_DBGIO

1 August: test at 120Hz heartbeat on UDB4: cpu load < 7%

2 August: port ring buffer and sofware flow control for OpenLog from MatrixPilotMulti
	test on UDB4 at 40MIPS and 40Hz heartbeat
	still need to separate DCM rate from PID rate

3 August: implement 200Hz IMU updates with HEARTBEAT_HZ set to 200Hz
	protect mavlink packet writes to ring buffer by raising IPL to 6 during copy
	bench test on AUAV3
