16 July: successful test flight in manual, stabilized and auto (waypoints) mode
	Addiction aircraft with production sample UDB5 and 3DR LEA6 GPS module using
	the same options.h settings as AVC, but with race mode off
	* need to reduce elevator boost and auto mode bank angle
	* logfile apparently corrupt; check mavlink baud rate

17 July: copied from -udb5-mw to configure bench testing with em406

19 July: began testing 64mips option
	*** note that analog2digital_udb4/5 are hard-coded for 16mips
	fixed bug in mpu.c: incorrect oscillator setting for 32MIPS

21 July: 40 MIPS support for UDB5 working, fixed ADC support for UDB5 (it was burning
	about 10% of the cpu at all speeds) now set to sample at ~25KHz regardless
	of FCY frequency.
	Tested at 16, 32 and 40MIPS: 8%, 4% and 3% cpu load, respectively.

17 August: need to flight test UDB5 at 40MIPS/200Hz

29 October:
        Getting the 4 waggles before ublox GPS is sending 3D fixes... Ready to
    fly with lat/lon still at 0,0; see branchStatus for notes on bugfix
        Also noted that libUDB/eeprom_udb4.c was still referenced by this project
    even though it is obsolete and replaced by 24LC256.c; deleted reference and
    verified that PID parameters are properly saved to eeprom and restored using
    QGroundControl v2.0.0
