project -udb4.X copied from -udb5.X on 24 July 2013

attempt to use prebuilt libVectorMatrix binary unsuccessful; link command
references correct file, but linker claims symbols are undefined. This works
in both the UDB5 and AUAV3 projects. Current workaround is to include the libVectorMatrix
sources in the compile.

Not yet bench tested

Bug??? using COF linker output format, linking with static lib VectorMatrix.a doesn't work

26 July: bench tested at 40mips: cpu load showing 4.6% with mavlink
	move magnetometerOptions.h from libUDB to MatrixPilot/projectSpecific
	and modify rmat.c include statement

28 July: start finishing up the HEARTBEAT_HZ parameterization; changes needed to all
	the GPS drivers and to rmat.c

10 August: copied from project -udb4.X
	bench tested with 200Hz heartbeat and SUE ASCII telemetry
