21 April 2013:
    Arsov AGPS module connected and working properly on bench.
    Not getting a green LED for radio_on indication; appears to be no IC1 interrupt

22 April:
    PWM inputs working correctly now, servo outputs also seem reasonable
    incorporated Robert's macro changes to radioIn_auav3.c

23 April:
    fixed InputCapture pin assignments for inputs 2/3 and 5/6

24 April:
    defined symbolic names for all IC and OC pins to help avoid mismatches
    between internal and external pin numbers
