21 April 2013:
    Arsov AGPS module connected and working properly on bench.
    Not getting a green LED for radio_on indication; appears to be no IC1 interrupt

22 April:
    PWM inputs working correctly now, servo outputs also seem reasonable
    incorporated Robert's macro changes to radioIn_auav3.c
