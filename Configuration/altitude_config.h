// Altitude Hold
// Use altitude hold in stabilized mode?  In waypoint mode?
// Each of these settings can be AH_NONE, AH_FULL, or AH_PITCH_ONLY
//  - In waypoint mode, the target altitude is defined by the waypoints or logo program.
//  - In stabilized mode, when ALTITUDEHOLD_STABILIZED is set to AH_PITCH_ONLY, the target
// altitude is whatever altitude the plane was at when switched into stabilized mode.
//  - In stabilized mode, when ALTITUDEHOLD_STABILIZED is set to AH_FULL, the target
// altitude is determined by the position of the throttle stick on the transmitter.
// NOTE: even when set to AH_NONE, MatrixPilot will still try to stabilize pitch as long
// as PITCH_STABILIZATION is set to 1 above, but will not aim for any specific altitude.
#define ALTITUDEHOLD_STABILIZED				AH_PITCH_ONLY
#define ALTITUDEHOLD_WAYPOINT				AH_FULL

// Speed Control
// If you define SPEED_CONTROL to be 1, MatrixPilot will take air speed into account
// in the altitude controls, and will trim the throttle and pitch to maintain air speed.
// Define DESIRED_SPEED to be the air speed that you want, in meters/second.
#define SPEED_CONTROL						0
#define DESIRED_SPEED						50.00 // meters/second

// This only takes effect when entering RTL mode, which only happens when the plane loses the transmitter signal.
