10 March 2013:
    MPU-6000 orientation is the same as the UDB4/breakout board config for MPQ6000dual.
    Roll, pitch and yaw axes have the correct orientations and servo channels
    1-3 respond to attitude changes.

13 March: blocking SPI register read shows correct output from MPU-6000 on scope, but
    SPI1BUF reads as zero???

14 March: include temperature register in MPU-6000 read, and output in telemetry
